Please note that this project is made for my personal portfolio and it was developed using React.js. However, I would like to note that this is one of my earlier projects, so it may not fully reflect my current level of skills and knowledge. Additionally, the project uses a mock API for a basic and improper authentication system and it was my first project where I utilized HTTP requests.
